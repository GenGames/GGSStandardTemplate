# GGS_StandardTemplate

This Template is meant to be used as a basis to help kickstart the creation of games by providing Quality of Life features that are often a pain to code, and potentially very time consuming, but provide lots to the end experience for the user.

*This is **NOT** an asset library, our intention isn't for this to be a catch-all for making games, just as a platform or stepping off point for ease of creation in future products*

Currently, the following features are implemented into the template:
 - Starting Menus scenes and scene management
 - Volume and graphics control settings
 - Autogenerated contribute credits
 - Player save data and a basic save system
 - Player achievements/achievement UI
 - Audio management for music, sfx, and ambiance
 - In game cinematics and cinematic events
 - A player driven event system
 - Data management at the Scene, Play, and Overall Game level
 - A small number of other rudimentary and modular controllers and utility scripts
